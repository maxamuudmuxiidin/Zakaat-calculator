      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;
      <p className="text-lg">
        <strong>Zakaat</strong>, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is a mandatory form of charity that requires Muslims to give a portion of their wealth to those in need. It serves not only as a means of redistributing wealth but also as a purification of one's wealth and soul. The term "Zakaat" is derived from the Arabic word "zakāh" (زَكَاة), which means purification, growth, and blessing. It is a religious duty that reflects the ethical and social dimensions of Islam.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        The obligation of Zakaat is explicitly mentioned in the Quran. Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 43:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="text-lg my-4">
        <p>"وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ وَارْكَعُوا مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ"</p>
        <p>"And establish prayer and give Zakaat and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience]." (Quran 2:43)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p className="text-lg">
        This verse underscores the importance of Zakaat alongside prayer, highlighting its significance in the life of a Muslim. The practice of giving Zakaat is not merely a financial obligation but a spiritual one that reinforces the unity and compassion within the Muslim community.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        The calculation of Zakaat involves specific criteria and conditions. The wealth upon which Zakaat is due must have reached a minimum threshold called the Nisab. The Nisab is equivalent to the value of 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver. Once a Muslim's savings exceed this threshold and a lunar year has passed, Zakaat becomes obligatory.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        The amount to be given as Zakaat is 2.5% of the total wealth. This includes cash, bank savings, investments, business inventory, gold, and silver. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) elaborated on the types of wealth subject to Zakaat in various Hadith. He said:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="text-lg my-4">
        <p>"لَيْسَ فِي مَالٍ زَكَاةٌ حَتَّى يَحُولَ عَلَيْهِ الْحَوْلُ"</p>
        <p>"No Zakaat is due on property until a year passes with it in one's possession." (Sunan Ibn Majah, 1792)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p className="text-lg">
        This Hadith indicates that the wealth must be in possession for a full lunar year before Zakaat is due, emphasizing the concept of sustained wealth rather than transient earnings.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        The recipients of Zakaat are clearly outlined in the Quran. In Surah At-Tawbah, Ayah 60, Allah says:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="text-lg my-4">
        <p>"إِنَّمَا الصَّدَقَاتُ لِلْفُقَرَاءِ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَالْعَامِلِينَ عَلَيْهَا وَالْمُؤَلَّفَةِ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَفِي الرِّقَابِ وَالْغَارِمِينَ وَفِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَابْنِ السَّبِيلِ فَرِيضَةً مِنَ اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ"</p>
        <p>"Zakaat expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect [Zakaat] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise." (Quran 9:60)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p className="text-lg">
        This verse categorically states the eight categories of recipients eligible for Zakaat, ensuring that the wealth is distributed to various segments of society who need it the most.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Zakaat also plays a critical role in reducing economic disparity and promoting social justice. By obligating the wealthy to support the less fortunate, it fosters a sense of responsibility and community among Muslims. It acts as a social safety net, preventing extreme poverty and allowing for a more equitable distribution of resources.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        The spiritual benefits of Zakaat are equally significant. It purifies the giver's wealth by removing the portion that rightfully belongs to the less fortunate, as described in the Hadith:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="text-lg my-4">
        <p>"خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِمْ بِهَا"</p>
        <p>"Take [O, Muhammad] from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase." (Quran 9:103)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p className="text-lg">
        This purification is both material and spiritual, as it removes greed and attachment to worldly possessions, leading to a more fulfilling and balanced life.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        In addition to the obligatory Zakaat, Islam encourages voluntary charity (Sadaqah). While Zakaat has specific rules and percentages, Sadaqah can be given at any time and in any amount. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="text-lg my-4">
        <p>"مَا نَقَصَتْ صَدَقَةٌ مِنْ مَالٍ"</p>
        <p>"Charity does not decrease wealth." (Sahih Muslim, 2588)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p className="text-lg">
        This Hadith emphasizes that giving in charity, whether obligatory or voluntary, brings blessings and does not diminish one's wealth, but rather, increases it in spiritual and sometimes material ways.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        In conclusion, Zakaat is a comprehensive system of social welfare in Islam that addresses both the material and spiritual needs of the community. It is a divine mandate that promotes economic equity, social cohesion, and personal purification. By fulfilling the obligation of Zakaat, Muslims not only comply with a key tenet of their faith but also contribute to the overall well-being and harmony of society.
